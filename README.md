# Gstreamer guide

To begin with understanding gstreamer, let's first understand the [hello world](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/hello-world.html?gi-language=c) code. This will show us how to use a inbuilt end-to-end pipeline - *playbin*. It will introduce the basic concept of [*bus*](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/application-development/basics/bus.html?gi-language=c) and [*message*](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/additional/design/messages.html?gi-language=c) in gstreamer.
   The [basic tutorial 2](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/concepts.html?gi-language=c) will help us understand how a custom pipleine is made and how error handling is done. Understand [different states in gstremer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/additional/design/states.html?gi-language=c) and how they differ in terms of data flow. 
   The [basic tutorial 3](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/dynamic-pipelines.html?gi-language=c) will have us to understand the concept of pads. Basically, all the elements have pads which facilitate the data flow from one element to another. There are 2 types of pads- source and sink. A pad can have 3 types of availibility- always, sometimes and on request.  In these tutorial we learn how to handle sometimes type of pad. We can learn about them in more detail over [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/application-development/basics/pads.html?gi-language=c). Major takeaway from this tutorial is to understand how various streams contained in same file can be handled using dynamic linking of pads.
   Now we can proceed to [basic tutorial 4](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/basic/time-management.html?gi-language=c). Main takeaway of this code will be to understand how to perfrom seek to anytime using the function [gst_element_seek_simple](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/gstreamer/gstelement.html?gi-language=c#gst_element_seek_simple). It also introduces us to concept of [GstQuery](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/gstreamer/gstquery.html?gi-language=c), which has a more wider use to query different information about an element or a pad. 
   As of now the main thing to notice is that, any gstreamer application uses lots of callback functions for various puposes (bus watching, pad linking etc). These callback function are timely called using the concept of [signals](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugin-development/basics/signals.html?gi-language=c). Also we need to understand the purpose and use of [gmain loop](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/gstreamer-sdk/data/docs/latest/glib/glib-The-Main-Event-Loop.html).
